PUMP AXI4 to AXI4 (PipeWork Example) (Translated from Japanese using Google, due to KAWAZOME Ichiro (ikwzm))

------------------------------------

###Overview###

It is so-called Scatter Gather DMA.
Input, output, Scatter The gather table loading is AXI 4 master interface,
Register access has AXI 4 slave interface.

####Development environment####

We are confirmed that we can synthesize in the following development environment.

* Xilinx ISE14.2
* Xilinx Vivado 2014.1

###IP for Xilinx###

./target/xilinx/ip/ikwzm_pipework_pump_axi4_to_axi4_0.8.zip     
./target/xilinx/ip/ikwzm_pipework_pump_axi3_to_axi3_0.8.zip 

###simulation###

We used GHDL (http://ghdl.free.fr/) for simulation.

Before compiling this module you need to move the current directory to ./PipeWork/sim/ghdl/ and ./Dummy_Plug/sim/ghdl/dummy_plug and run make in each directory to make the library Yes.

The scenario file for verification is generated by a ruby script called src / test / scenarios / make_scenario.rb.

To compile and simulate this module, we have a Makefile, so please execute the make command.

###Caution###

For the time being a simple test is done, it is not perfect, especially abnormal systems are untouched.

###license###

It is published in two clause BSD license (2-clause BSD license).
